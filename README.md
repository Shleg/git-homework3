_*Practices and tools for working with Git*_

1. Invite someone from your training colleagues to your project, give them access to your repository (except for the master branch).  
2. Set him a task on your project in GitHub, ask him to complete it in a separate branch, and after completing it, create a pull request and transfer the task back to you.  
3. Check the completion of the task, accept the pull request and delete the branch in which this task was solved.
